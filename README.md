# keyboards
Just a repo with custom config for my programming keyboard as it is the main use on a daily basis.
It's just the EN-US layout with just the number row shifted from 1 to '-'. Makes it easier on the hands while typing most part of the day.

// TODO: add link to the microsoft download page.
## Windows
There's the installer and the .klc if you want to make some changes using msklc (make sure you install it directly under the drive's root since it fails to make the .dll's if not).
